# Angular 1.5+ Component Test Project
The purpose of this project is to experiment with git: `committing`, `pushing`, `pulling`, etc. Per the request of Prime
students we decided to build an Angular 1 component-driven app. It is expected that you have Git and NPM installed on your machine!
If you do not install them via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or through whatever method you prefer. If you are unsure how to do this
please consult your instructor. I was the guy who `rm -rf`'d his hard drive and I don't want to get people in similar situations.

## Please note that being able to play with these files is not mandatory. The purpose of this speech is to review git, not to build an Angular 1 application. 


### Downloading Files
Open up your terminal and navigate to a folder where you'd like the code to be installed
and type:

```git
git clone https://github.com/hankandre/ng1-component-starter.git

```

Git will download the files associated with the project; `cd` into that folder. Now you need to download the dependencies. Type in `npm install`
and `npm start` to get up and running!


### Note
This app is pretty stable. I'll be spending some time messing things up and we'll get to fix them during the presentation.
